      <description>Arnqvist&amp;rsquo;s Lab. Before ESEB 2019, I visited Arnqvist Lab., Uppsala, Sweden. Thank you to Dr. GÃ¶ran Arnqvist for talking to me about the research equipment and how to rear bean weevils. And thank you to everyone at Arnqvist Lab. for taking the time to do this, regardless of the summer break.</description>

      <description>SEM Photo of Bean weevils Males of Callasobruchus maculatus have exaggerated spins on genitalias. These spins often hurt their mates.
They have been treated as model organisms of sexual conflict by these harmful spins.
The two photos belows show male genitalias of two geographic strains, implying that the intensity of sexual conflict (and also sexual selection) varied depending on strains.</description>
